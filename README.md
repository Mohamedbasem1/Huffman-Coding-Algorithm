# Huffman-Coding-Algorithm
ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This project implements Huffman Coding, a lossless data compression algorithm. Huffman Coding assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters, optimizing data storage and transmission.

ðŸš€ Features

Compresses text using Huffman Encoding.

Decompresses Huffman encoded text.

Displays the Huffman Tree with character-to-code mapping.

Simple and efficient implementation in C++.

ðŸ›  How It Works

Frequency Calculation: Determines the frequency of each character in the input text.

Building the Huffman Tree: Constructs a binary tree based on character frequency.

Generating Huffman Codes: Assigns shorter binary codes to more frequent characters.

Encoding the Input: Replaces characters with their respective Huffman codes.

Decoding the Compressed Data: Recovers the original te
